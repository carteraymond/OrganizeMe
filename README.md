# OrganizeMe
This is the final project for our CSE 341 Class.
OrganizeMe is a task management app designed to help users stay organized and productive. It allows users to create, categorize, and prioritize tasks, while offering seamless integration with OAuth for secure login. With features like task filtering, category creation, and real-time updates, users can easily manage their daily to-dos. The app also supports a robust GraphQL API, ensuring fast and flexible interaction with data. Whether you're tracking simple to-dos or managing larger projects, OrganizeMe keeps everything structured and easy to access.
